Integrating external applications with Salesforce is a common requirement for many organizations.
One of the key steps in this integration process is the creation of a Connected App in Salesforce, which allows external applications to securely authenticate and access Salesforce data.
In this guide, we will walk through the necessary steps to create a Connected App, retrieve API credentials, and generate an **Access Token** using the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Type**.

<Image src={salesforcelogo} alt="" />

## Step 1: Create a New Connected App

- In the Setup menu, search for `App Manager` using the Quick Find box.
- Click on `New Connected App` in the top right corner of the App Manager.

### Enter Application Information

Fill in the necessary detail for your Connected App:

- `Connected App Name`: Name your app.
- `API Name`: Provide a unique name for internal use.
- `Contact Email`: Your email address for communication regarding the app.
- Check `Enable OAuth Settings` to enable OAuth for your app.
- `Callback URL`: Input a callback URL where users will be redirected after authentication. Use a placeholder URL like `https://test.salesforce.com`
- Configure `OAuth Scopes`:
  - Add `Manage user data via APIs (api)` to allow your app to access and manage user data.
  - Add `Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)` to enable your app to perform requests even when the user is not actively logged in.

## Step 2: Retrieve API Credentials

On the Connected App page, click on the `Manage Consumer Details` button.

Store the `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret` securely as you will need them later.

```yaml
Consumer Key: 3MVG96qSbA1.IAawvmoc43T6NGCFv2cTzR1aIeavlhdl_xTKAEQv4amTtIqkZBbtvdgfpypIErSxXTJUcS3A2
Consumer Secret: E16D484164C61E04819A6E09F8157E89281717200F60013F9CD3D237DE218CCC
```

## Step 3: Construct Your URL

When using a Sandbox, the beginning of your URL should be `https://mycompany--sandbox1.sandbox.my.salesforce.com`.

Include these parameters in your URL:

```
response_type=code
client_id=<your consumer key>
redirect_uri=<the callback url defined in your connected app>
```

Your URL should resemble the following:

```url
https://mycompany--sandbox1.sandbox.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=3MVG96qSbA1.IAawvmoc43T6NGCFv2cTzR1aIeavlhdl_xTKAEQv4amTtIqkZBbtvdgfpypIErSxXTJUcS3A2&redirect_uri=https://test.salesforce.com
```

## Step 4: Paste the URL in your browser

After constructing the URL, paste it into your browser's address bar and navigate to it.
You should now be able to log in using your user credentials.
Salesforce will handle the connection for you, granting you access to the platform.

## Step 5: Retrieve the Authorization Code

After the redirect, a new URL will appear in your browser containing the authorization code. Copy the code that appears after `?code=`.

For instance, in my case: 

```yaml
aPrxBvbu.uSmURP0a4luKUouGQtOtx7NTrYomSjgdKywRDOXokwyZBaw55b1M8S1F0sXC7Co8Q%3D%3D
```

<Image src={step5_getAuthorizationCode} alt="" />

## Step 6: Perform a GET Request using Postman

To build your GET request in Postman, use the following parameters:

```
code=<your authorization code>
grant_type=authorization_code
client_id=<your consumer key>
client_secret=<your consumer secret>
redirect_url=<callback url on the connected app>
```

Construct your URL like this:

```url
https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token?code=aPrxBvbu.uSmURP0a4luKUouGQtOtx7NTrYomSjgdKywRDOXokwyZBaw55b1M8S1F0sXC7Co8Q%3D%3D&grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=3MVG96qSbA1.IAawvmoc43T6NGCFv2cTzR1aIeavlhdl_xTKAEQv4amTtIqkZBbtvdgfpypIErSxXTJUcS3A2&client_secret=E16D484164C61E04819A6E09F8157E89281717200F60013F9CD3D237DE218CCC&redirect_uri=https://test.salesforce.com
```

Click "Send" to receive your response. Expect a status code of 200, along with the **Access Token** in the response body.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the goal of the process is to generate an Access Token using the OAuth 2.0
Authorization Code Grant Type. This Access Token is crucial for making authenticated requests to the
Salesforce API on behalf of the user. By creating a Connected App, retrieving API credentials, and
following the OAuth flow, you can securely integrate external applications with Salesforce and access
its features and data. It's essential to store API credentials securely and follow best practices for
authentication and authorization to ensure the security of your Salesforce integration.
